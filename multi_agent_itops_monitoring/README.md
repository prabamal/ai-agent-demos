# 🔍 Multi-Agent ITOps Monitoring

## 📌 Overview
Supervisor–worker system where agents monitor, analyze, and remediate IT Ops alerts.

## 🎯 Problem
Manual monitoring is reactive and slow. This project shows automated detection → analysis → remediation.

## 🛠️ Design
- SupervisorAgent orchestrates workflows
- MonitoringAgent: collects metrics and generates alerts
- AnalysisAgent: performs root cause analysis
- RemediationAgent: executes playbooks (CPU/memory issues)

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python multi_agent_itops_monitoring.py
