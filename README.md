# 🤖 AI Agent Portfolio – Autonomous ITOps Projects  

This portfolio demonstrates my hands-on experience building **Agentic AI systems** for **autonomous IT Operations (ITOps)**.  
The projects align directly with the skills and patterns listed in the job posting for **AI Agent Developers – Interns & Fresh Grads**.

## 📂 Projects  

### 1. ⚡ Event-Driven Agent Orchestration  
- Demonstrates **event-driven AI orchestration** with an event bus, routing, retries, and dead-letter queues.  
- Agents handle **alerts, metrics, remediation, deployments, workflows, and audits**.  
- **Job Match:** Event-driven & message-queue orchestration (Kafka/RabbitMQ style), multi-turn workflow reasoning, failover strategies.  

---

### 2. 🔍 Multi-Agent ITOps Monitoring  
- Implements a **supervisor–worker multi-agent model**.  
- **Agents:** Monitoring → Analysis → Remediation, with automated playbooks.  
- **Job Match:** Multi-agent orchestration, supervisor–worker patterns, self-healing workflows.  

---

### 3. 🧠 RAG-Based Knowledge Agent  
- A **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agent** that answers ITOps queries.  
- Uses embeddings + vector store for **semantic search**.  
- **Knowledge Base:** CPU, memory, disk, network, Kubernetes, DB, incidents.  
- **Job Match:** Vector DBs (FAISS/Pinecone), RAG pipelines, context injection & memory persistence.  

---

### 4. 🛠️ Tool-Calling Agent  
- AI agent that **calls external tools/APIs dynamically**.  
- Tools include **server monitoring, alerts, service restart, scaling, DB queries, notifications, log reading**.  
- Features: **tool usage, planning, retries, timeouts, permissions**.  
- **Job Match:** Tool usage, dynamic planning, API integration, applied AI.
